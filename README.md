Surveying resources
This Repo contains general surveying software, algos, and working code used in the field of surveying. This code is made public on a CC0 license, however caution must be exercised if relying on this code for any safety critical work. To the extent possible by law, the author and/or publisher and/or Repo owner/operator disclaims any and all liability arising from use of code contained herein. Particularly, code may be written with "acceptable" error for the purpose which it was intended (for example running an inverse geodetic problem once rather than multiple iterations) and the error may not be effectively communicated to the end user. Caveat!
